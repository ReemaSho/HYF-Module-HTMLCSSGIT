1- create a hidden folder (we add a dot "."  before the name to make it hidden),example:   mkdir .myFolderName           
  create a hidden file  (we add a dot "."  before the name to make it hidden),example:     touch .myFileName.txt 
  display hidden folders and files, we use "ls" to display the folders and files in the current directory, with "a" which stands for all.
  example:      ls -a 


2- mkdir -p    this command let us make more than on directory at once, example: 
    mkdir -p my/first/homework/for/HYF


3- In order to append new information to a file without overwritten what is already existed in it , we use double arrows, example:      
  echo "my new info" >> myFileName.txt
